# Evolving Choropleth

Choropleth maps are a great way to visualize data across geographical regions.  A typical example would be a population density map that uses colour to encode the population density in different regions.  Most choropleth maps are static, so they only show the data at one point in time.  I was interested in creating a dynamic data visualization that would change with the passage of time, so I created a map to visualize the growth of internet usage through the world since 1990.  I created this map using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) (version 3), which is a JavaScript library for producing interactive data visualizations.  Note that version 3 is not the newest version of d3 (there is now a version 4).

The original dataset is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o2v5n--85X8_VHrcNNgp4RpeHK4PFIVsEwBUOW9RiFY/pub).  In order to make my life easier, I did some initial data cleaning and manipulation.  I prefer to work with datasets in [tidy](http://www.jeannicholashould.com/tidy-data-in-python.html) format, and the original dataset was not in this format.  Tidy format makes it easier to do analysis with the dataset, and it makes your results more reproducible because it puts the dataset into a standard format that many people are familiar with.
